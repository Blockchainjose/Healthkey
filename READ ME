About This Project
HealthKey is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain that empowers individuals to own, track, and optionally monetize their health data — from daily habits to wearable-generated insights.

In a world where corporations control most health data behind closed systems, HealthKey gives ownership back to the user. Through a secure, blockchain-based infrastructure and optional token incentives, users can store key wellness metrics, log personal records, and participate in health-related challenges — all while keeping control of their data.

Vision
To create the Web3 standard for health data ownership, where:

You control who sees and uses your health records

You decide whether to monetize your data — or keep it private

You get rewarded for staying healthy and active

Whether you're uploading data manually or integrating with wearables like Apple Health, Whoop, or Eight Sleep (coming soon), HealthKey is building the bridge between your body and your blockchain identity.

Core Features
Personal Health Record Logging
Log health metrics like weight, sleep, blood pressure, or exercise data.

Blockchain-Based Ownership
Data is stored via decentralized methods — user-owned, tamper-proof.

Incentivized Rewards System
Users receive $HEALTH tokens for participating in logging, submitting, and optionally sharing anonymized health data.

Future Dashboard Integration (In Development)
Real-time data visualization and integration with leading wearables.

Data Pooling + Marketplace Potential
Users may opt-in to contribute anonymized data into health research pools and receive staking rewards.

Tech Stack
Solana – ultra-fast, low-cost blockchain

Anchor – smart contract framework

Webflow – frontend UI (Web3-integrated)
